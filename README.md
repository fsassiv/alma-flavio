## Tech Choises

- NextJS
- Mocked API with NextJS API
- Authentication with Next-Auth
- Data Storage with Prisma
- File upload applied and persistend on database
- Reack-hook-form used instead of JsonForms, due to not enough time to be confident using JsonForms
- No State Managemente needed, but Context API would be my choice
- Typescript and responssiveness applied
- No unit tests or functionalities, due to timeline
